OurAPI was designed initially as a teaching tool.
It allows simple and rapid development of a REST, json API,
providing live feedback of requests through it's GUI.

It also include GET and POST clients to test the interface,
though any http client (including a web browser) can query the api.

Beyond being a teaching tool, OurAPI allows for extremely simple and
rapid API prototyping by simply editing the definitions.ini file
to include functions, their parameters and accompanying sql queries
